	"description": "A couple of years ago I bought myself a Raspberry Pi and using it as a home server hosting there a bunch of different apps. The whole setup went through several iterations and is still evolving. I'd like to share with you what I have there and how it is helping me in my day-to-day life. There will be several posts in order to make it more readable, so keep in touch",
