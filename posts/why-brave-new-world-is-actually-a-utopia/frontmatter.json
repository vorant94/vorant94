	"description": "Some time ago, I read Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\" The book made a strong impression on me even though I had already read Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\" and George Orwell's \"1984.\" I noticed a particular difference between this dystopian novel and the other two, but I couldn't put it into words for some reason.

In the end, we concluded that \"Brave New World\" is more of a utopia than a dystopia. So, here are my thoughts on the matter.",
