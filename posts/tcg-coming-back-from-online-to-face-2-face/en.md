# TCG: coming back from online to face-2-face

*While being for the most part a digital person myself I noticed a trend in my taste shifting more towards analog experience. I bought a paper notebook instead of making notes in apps, I do plan to swap my Apple Watch, that I almost don't use, in favor of regular clock and so on. Among other things I got interested in Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that is more than 30 years old. It has digital version as well called Magic: The Gathering Arena. While mechanically those versions try to give similar experience there are still a lot of difference solely because of different digital/analog nature of the games. I'd like to share my observations on this topic*

## Out of stock

The first and most noticeable difference for me was the boundaries, that the real world itself puts on you. There is no such a thing as "out of stock" in any of digital games nor for the game itself nor for in-game purchasables items. Found a deck you wanna try or skin you really liked? At any moment of day or night just buy it either with in-game currency or with regular money!

It's not that simple with paper version. Your go-to option for getting cards would be your local game-shop. If you don't live in the heart of the civilization, there would probably isn't such shop in your town, only in a megapolis near by (if there is such). Of course there is a plenty of second-hand markets online, where you can buy cards you need, but it usually has a very obvious problem - delivery cost. You don't want to pay 5$ for the delivery of a card worth 10 cents. Needless to say these markets can simply not provide delivery to your country.

But even if you have a game-shop on the next to your street or even if you have enough money to pay all the delivery costs in the world there still no guarantee you can get what you imagined. Cards can simply be out of stock! "Sounds like a bump, no?", you might think. I would argue otherwise.

The thing is that human creativity thrives when it has boundaries or borders. When you can't get what you want you start coming up with replacement ideas, you start diving deep, you start thinking, you stop consuming and start creating. When you can buy literally anything with the same price of one card you are lost, you will tend to skip deck building by finding some deck online, that is supposed to be fun to play and you will start with it. Hopefully after month or so you'll start to patch this deck. You played this deck a couple of times, you know its weaknesses and have some ideas how to fix them.  If you look back on what happened you essentially created a boundaries you didn't like initially all by yourself, you decided to go with this one deck and not some another.

In paper version you are starting with those boundaries and instead of being restricted by one deck, you are restricted by what your game-shop have in stock. You start thinking "OK, what can I build out from what I have?". Or if you wish you can still start with ready-to-play deck by buying a pre-constructed one and then essentially continue as you would with digital version. But still analog version gives you way more changes to de-rail from your initial starting point and go exploring.

I always wondered how people come up with deck ideas, now I got it. I missed that feeling from childhood, when you come to market without something pre-planned to be bought, but to see what is in there, whether there is something worth attention and to decide in place ~~to buy or not to buy~~ to build or not to build.

# Whiteboard

- digital TCG doesn't have actual "T" element, it is actually CCG
- dailies either mean that you don't respect your own game (your players need an additional motivation to play it besides the game itself) or you are a greedy bastard (the whole game economy is built upon donating, but to keep "free to play" label you have to provide some way to progress in it naturally, but still motivate to spend money)... or you are still greedy bastard, but in another way (dailies keep players coming back more frequently so the more time they spend in game the more chances you have to advertise in-game shop)
- in analog version main way to build a deck is buying singles you need from other players, CCG element nullifies it
- in-game second hand market isn't impossible mission, example of successful one is Steam
- in digital version there is no need to worry about missed triggers, no need to count counters manually, no need to bring with you required amount of tokens, no need to remember all the rules in details
- in digital version is it harder to bluff not having an instant, when you actually have one
- in digital version you can't redo your action even if opponent didn't do anything since then
- a couple of games a week vs a couple of games a day
- since it is easier to play (a couple of games a day) digital version is better used as a platform to get familiar with cards and decks, but the attention to details (like for manual countering and stuff) isn't being trained
- also the "get familiar" point becomes less relevant because of all the 'through the omenpaths' bullshit with upcoming Spider Man set
- ranking system is a perfect working tool to find a fitting opponent, although it adds some unnecessary pressure to progress more and get the highest rank at all cost (mono red aggro)
- analog "skins" have a lot more sensory effects than digital: new deck box has its own smell and texture, new sleeves can result in different shuffling experience. while all that digital skins can bring to the table is just visuals (2d picture, 3d model, maybe some animations with sound)
- MTG like any other digital micro-transaction game wants to own everything: cards you can use, formats you can play, events you can participate and so on
