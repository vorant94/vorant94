# TCG: coming back from online to face-2-face

*While being for the most part a digital person myself I noticed a trend in my taste shifting more towards analog experience. I bought a paper notebook instead of making notes in apps, I do plan to swap my Apple Watch, that I almost don't use, in favor of regular clock and so on. Among other things I got interested in Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that is more than 30 years old. It has digital version as well called Magic: The Gathering Arena. While mechanically those versions try to give similar experience there are still a lot of difference solely because of different digital/analog nature of the games. I'd like to share my observations on this topic*

## Out of stock

The first and most noticeable difference for me was the boundaries, that the real world itself puts on you. There is no such a thing as "out of stock" in any of digital games nor for the game itself nor for in-game purchasables items. Found a deck you wanna try or skin you really liked? At any moment of day or night just buy it either with in-game currency or with regular money!

It's not that simple with paper version. Your go-to option for getting cards would be your local game-shop. If you don't live in the heart of the civilization, there would probably isn't such shop in your town, only in a megapolis near by (if there is such). Of course there is a plenty of second-hand markets online, where you can buy cards you need, but it usually has a very obvious problem - delivery cost. You don't want to pay 5$ for the delivery of a card worth 10 cents. Needless to say these markets can simply not provide delivery to your country.

But even if you have a game-shop on the next to your street or even if you have enough money to pay all the delivery costs in the world there still no guarantee you can get what you imagined. Cards can simply be out of stock! "Sounds like a bump, no?", you might think. I would argue otherwise.

The thing is that human creativity thrives when it has boundaries or borders. When you can't get what you want you start coming up with replacement ideas, you start diving deep, you start thinking, you stop consuming and start creating. When you can buy literally anything with the same price of one card you are lost, you will tend to skip deck building by finding some deck online, that is supposed to be fun to play and you will start with it. Hopefully after month or so you'll start to patch this deck. You played this deck a couple of times, you know its weaknesses and have some ideas how to fix them.  If you look back on what happened you essentially created a boundaries you didn't like initially all by yourself, you decided to go with this one deck and not some another.

In paper version you are starting with those boundaries and instead of being restricted by one deck, you are restricted by what your game-shop have in stock. You start thinking "OK, what can I build out from what I have?". Or if you wish you can still start with ready-to-play deck by buying a pre-constructed one and then essentially continue as you would with digital version. But still analog version gives you way more changes to de-rail from your initial starting point and go exploring.

I always wondered how people come up with deck ideas, now I got it. I missed that feeling from childhood, when you come to market without something pre-planned to be bought, but to see what is in there, whether there is something worth attention and to decide in place ~~to buy or not to buy~~ to build or not to build.
