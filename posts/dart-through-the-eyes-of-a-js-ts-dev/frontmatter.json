	"description": "Earlier this year I had an app idea (hopefully I'll write about it too), which led me out from my programmers \"homeland\", front-end web dev, to another direction. Since the idea was an app, I needed to learn mobile dev a little bit. I decided to go cross-platform with Dart & Flutter. It is my first experience of somewhat serious programming not in JS/TS and I'd like to share with you what I learned so far",
